#+TITLE:Programming RUST

* Introduction

This project is used in order for me to learn the RUST language. I start this endevour on Sunday 23 January 2022, by following the RUST [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html][documentation]].

* Project 1: Hello World

The traditional Hello World program.

* Project 2: Cargo

We use cargo to keep track of the dependencies. We can run
#+begin_src shell
cargo build 
#+end_src
to build a project,
#+begin_src shell
cargo run
#+end_src
to build and run a project and
#+begin_src shell
cargo check 
#+end_src
to build a program without building it. Instead of saving the executable in the same directory, Cargo stores it in the =/target/debug= directory.
